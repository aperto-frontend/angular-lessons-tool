# Angular Lessons Tool

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0 and has
some slight modifications to use a websockets powered nodejs backend.

## Installation
Run `nvm use` inside of this folder, to use a predefined node version.<br/>
Optional: Install yarn using `npm install -g yarn`.<br/>
Use `npm install` or `yarn` to install node modules dependencies.

## Development server

Run `yarn start` or `npm run start` for a dev server running parallel to a websockets nodejs webserver.<br/> Use the browser tab opened for you or navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app and/or the server will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
